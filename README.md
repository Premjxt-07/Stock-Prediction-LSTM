# Stock-Prediction-LSTM

The prediction of stock value is a complex task which needs a robust algorithm background to 
compute the longer-term share prices. Stock prices are correlated within the nature of market; 
hence it will be difficult to predict the costs. The proposed algorithm using the market data to 
predict the share price using machine learning techniques like recurrent neural network named 
as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), in that process weights are corrected for each datapoints
using stochastic gradient descent.
This system will provide accurate outcomes in comparison to currently available stock price
predictor algorithms. The network istrained and evaluated with varioussizes of input data to urge
the graphical outcomes.
